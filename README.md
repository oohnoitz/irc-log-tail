IRC Log Tail
============

An online IRC Log Viewer that uses React.js + ES6 to display the last `N`
lines, current activity, and various other information for a channel. It
is done by polling/streaming a log stored in a database by a bot.

Note: It doesn't include the `api.php` file requested in `js/app.js`.
